## Project Description

In this project, I worked with a raw sales dataset that included customer details, order transactions, product information, territories, and deal sizes. The data was initially messy with inconsistent patterns and multiple empty cells.

I used the Power Query editor in Excel to clean the data by fixing column types, renaming headers, and correcting inconsistencies.

I built relationships within the cleaned dataset through referencing and data modeling, and created calculated measures in Excel to generate meaningful insights.

With these, I was able to analyze time-based sales trends, Customer insights, Product performance, and Geographic breakdown.
